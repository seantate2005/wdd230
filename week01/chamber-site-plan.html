    <h1>Plan for Chamber of Commerce</h1>
    <h2>Site Name</h2>
    <p>Blackstone, Virginia Chamber of Commerce</p>
    <h2>Site Purpose</h2>
    <p>The Blackstone Chamber of Commerce is the largest city in Nottoway County, Virginia.  As such we are home to Fort Barfoot, the counties only Walmart and Food Lion grocery stores.  We are also home to 90% of the restaurants in the county.  As such, we provide leadership for our county in all things economics.  We promote our business members and provide trainings for our members, who are mostly local owners who could not get the trainings as easily without us. We also work with both our city and county governments to ensure that new businesses are always coming into the area.</p>
    <h2>Scenario</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>How can the Chamber of Commerce help my company?</li>
        <li>Where can I find the offerings of trainings for locally owned businesses?</li>
        <li>Where can I find information on the local area?</li>
        <li>Where can I find the contact information for the Chamber's leadership?</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Color Schema</h2>
    <p>The colors will be based off of the local high school's team colors. This will include a dark maroon with a lighter yellow.</p>
